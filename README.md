# Programming-and-Problem-Solving-Using-Python

This repository contains the code examples, practice problems, and assignments for the Programming and Problem Solving Using Python course.

The repository is organized by week. Each week's folder contains folders for the different topics that are covered in that week. Within each topic's folder, there are files for the code examples, practice problems, and assignments.

The README file for each week provides more information about the contents of that week's folder.

The repository also includes a folder called "other resources" that contains other resources that students may find helpful, such as textbooks, articles, or websites.

To use this repository, students should clone it to their local machine. They can then open the files in their favorite code editor and start working on the code examples and practice problems.

The assignments can be submitted to the instructor by uploading them to the course's LMS.

This repository is still under development, so please let me know if you have any feedback.
